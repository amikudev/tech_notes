# Destructuring for arrays and objects

Array destructuring.

```typescript
const hobbies = ["Chanting", "Reading", "Hearing", "Prasadam"];

const [hobby1, hobby2, remainingHobbies] = hobbies;
```

Object destructuring.

```typescript
const person = {
  name: "Krsna",
  age: "16",
  father: "Vasudev",
};

const { name, age, ...restPerson } = person;

const { name: userName, age: userAge, father } = person;
```

Note that for object destucturing, the keys have to be property names

However, we can change the names of the properties like in the second example.

Also, Typescript does not only compiles your ts code to js code.
But it also compiles modern javascript features to the javascript
version that your web browsers support. (e.g. translation of destructuring syntax to es5 code)
