# Arrow functions

exmaple

```typescript
let myFunc: (x: number, y: number) => number = (x: number, y: number) => {
    return x + y;
}

//shorthand notation if you have only 1 statement that is a return statement
let shorthandFunction = (x: number, y: number) => x + y;
let shorthandFunction1 = (x: number, y: number) => x**y + y;
let shorthandFunction2 = (x: number) => x*2;
let shorthandFunction3 = x => x*2;
let shorthandFunction4: (x: number) => number
    = x => x*2;

// When this will be beneficial, hover over the event declaration 
// in the exmaple below and you will see that event is already define as of type: MouseEvent
let button = document.querySelector('button');
if(button) {
    button.addEventListener("click", event => console.log(event));
}

let arr = [2, 3, 4]
let sqareArr = arr.map(x => x*x);

```
