# Let and Const

* **Const is clear**
* **Always use let and const** 
* why do we need let when we already had var in JS.
    * var only has 2 scopes, functional scope and global scope. so anything that is not in function scope is added in global scope. like..

* Let uses block scope. A variable is always available in the scope in which you define it, or any lower blocks. 
    * It is a very good thing, because it forces you to write a lot cleaner code.
    * Another fancy name for this is lexical scope also.

for example, in javascript 
```javascript
{
    var x = 20;
    {
        var y = 30;
    }
}
```
both x and y will be attached to global scope, which is not a good thing.
