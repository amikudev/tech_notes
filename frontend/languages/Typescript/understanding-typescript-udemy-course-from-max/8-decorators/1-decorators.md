# Decorators

All decorators are functions, that fire on particular times.

In tsconfig.json it is a must to make target at least ES6 and 
enable experimentalDecorators to true, Failing which, our decorators will not work.

It is best to start decorator names with capital letters, though it is not compulsory, but it is a good market practice.

Declarators execute when your class is defined, not when it is instantiated.
