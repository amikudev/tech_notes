    <h1>Bhagvad Gita as it is</h1>
    <hr />
    <section class="chapter">
      <p>
        Originally i wrote Bhagvad-gita As Its Is in the the form in which it is
        presented now. When this book was first published, the original
        manuscript was, unfortunately, cut short to less than 400 pages, without
        illustrations and without explanations for most of the original verses
        of the Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā. In all of my other books –
        Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śrī Īśopaniṣad, etc. – the system is that I give the
        original verse, its English transliteration, word-for-word
        Sanskrit-English equivalents, translations and purports. This makes the
        book very authentic and scholarly and makes the meaning self-evident. I
        was not very happy, therefore, when I had to minimize my original
        manuscript. But later on, when the demand for Bhagavad-gītā As It Is
        considerably increased, I was requested by many scholars and devotees to
        present the book in its original form. Thus the present attempt is to
        offer the original manuscript of this great book of knowledge with full
        paramparā explanation in order to establish the Kṛṣṇa consciousness
        movement more soundly and progressively. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness
        movement is genuine, historically authorized, natural and transcendental
        due to its being based on Bhagavad-gītā As It Is. It is gradually
        becoming the most popular movement in the entire world, especially
        amongst the younger generation. It is becoming more and more interesting
        to the older generation also. Older gentlemen are becoming interested,
        so much so that the fathers and grandfathers of my disciples are
        encouraging us by becoming life members of our great society, the
        International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In Los Angeles many
        fathers and mothers used to come to see me to express their feelings of
        gratitude for my leading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement throughout the
        entire world. Some of them said that it is greatly fortunate for the
        Americans that I have started the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in
        America. But actually the original father of this movement is Lord Kṛṣṇa
        Himself, since it was started a very long time ago but is coming down to
        human society by disciplic succession. If I have any credit in this
        connection, it does not belong to me personally, but it is due to my
        eternal spiritual master, His Divine Grace Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa
        Parivrājakācārya 108 Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī
        Mahārāja Prabhupāda. If personally I have any credit in this matter, it
        is only that I have tried to present Bhagavad-gītā as it is, without any
        adulteration. Before my presentation of Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, almost
        all the English editions of Bhagavad-gītā were introduced to fulfill
        someone’s personal ambition. But our attempt, in presenting
        Bhagavad-gītā As It Is, is to present the mission of the Supreme
        Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Our business is to present the will of
        Kṛṣṇa, not that of any mundane speculator like the politician,
        philosopher or scientist, for they have very little knowledge of Kṛṣṇa,
        despite all their other knowledge. When Kṛṣṇa says, man-manā bhava
        mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru, etc., we, unlike the so-called
        scholars, do not say that Kṛṣṇa and His inner spirit are different.
        Kṛṣṇa is absolute, and there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa’s name,
        Kṛṣṇa’s form, Kṛṣṇa’s qualities, Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, etc. This absolute
        position of Kṛṣṇa is difficult to understand for any person who is not a
        devotee of Kṛṣṇa in the system of paramparā (disciplic succession).
        Generally the so-called scholars, politicians, philosophers and svāmīs,
        without perfect knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, try to banish or kill Kṛṣṇa when
        writing commentary on Bhagavad-gītā. Such unauthorized commentary upon
        Bhagavad-gītā is known as māyāvāda-bhāṣya, and Lord Caitanya has warned
        us about these unauthorized men. Lord Caitanya clearly says that anyone
        who tries to understand Bhagavad-gītā from the Māyāvādī point of view
        will commit a great blunder. The result of such a blunder will be that
        the misguided student of Bhagavad-gītā will certainly be bewildered on
        the path of spiritual guidance and will not be able to go back to home,
        back to Godhead.
