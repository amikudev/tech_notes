# Approach to create a react app.

Thinking in react.

1. Understand the requirement very well and write it in bullet points if required.
2. Design a minimal state of the app and decide where you will keep the app.
    * In the app only or in redux.
3. Build your component hierarchy.
    * Write them top down or bottom up way.
