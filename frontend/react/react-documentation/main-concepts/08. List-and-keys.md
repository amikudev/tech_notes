# List and Keys

Always use keys for looping

```jsx
const listItems = numbers.map((number) => (
  <li key={number.toString()}>{number}</li>
));
```

Best is to pick id from your objects

When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

```jsx
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) => (
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs
  <li key={index}>{todo.text}</li>
));
```

A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.

## Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings

Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:

## Key is not passed to called component

you need to pass it explicitly if you need it there

```jsx
const content = posts.map((post) => (
  <Post key={post.id} id={post.id} title={post.title} />
));
```
