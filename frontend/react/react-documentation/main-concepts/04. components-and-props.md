# Components and Props

Functional components are just valid javascript functions which return jsx

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

ES6 class based component

```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

TIP: Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.
Because react treats tags with small case letters as DOM tags and does not complains if it is not able find that component in our code.

### When to extract components

- TO reduce code duplication
- To manage code complexity.

## Props are read only.

Weather you declare a component as a function or as a class, it **must** never modify its own props.

React is pretty flexible but has a single strict rule.

**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**
